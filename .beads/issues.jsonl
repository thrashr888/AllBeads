Currently it appears to process repositories sequentially which causes significant delays with many contexts (34+ repos).\n\n## Symptoms\n\n1. **Slow performance**: Commands hang while showing '⏳ Refreshing beads from repositories...'\n2. **No progress feedback**: User has no visibility into which repos are being scanned\n3. **Auth errors not handled gracefully**: SSH auth failures (e.g. terraform-provider-registry) show raw error traces\n\n## Example Error\n```\nERROR allbeads::aggregator::boss_aggregator: Failed to fetch terraform-provider-registry: Git library error: remote rejected authentication: Failed getting response; class=Ssh (23); code=Auth (-16)\n    at src/aggregator/boss_aggregator.rs:163\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Parallel async batches**: Refresh repositories concurrently using tokio async runtime\n2. **Common code**: Consolidate refresh logic so fixes apply everywhere (stats, list, etc.)\n3. **Progress indicator**: Show real-time progress as repos are scanned\n4. **Repo list display**: Optionally show which repositories are currently being scanned\n5. **Better error handling**: Handle auth failures gracefully without stack traces\n\n## Affected Commands\n\n- `ab stats`\n- `ab list`\n- Other commands that refresh beads\n\n## Location\n\n- `src/aggregator/boss_aggregator.rs:163` (error handling)\n- Refresh logic throughout CLI commands","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-16T01:54:41.82305-08:00","created_by":"Paul Thrasher","updated_at":"2026-01-16T02:10:54.07133-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T02:10:54.07133-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented parallel async refresh with progress indicator:\n- Added sync_repos_parallel() using tokio::task::spawn_blocking for concurrent git operations\n- Added RefreshProgress enum for progress callbacks\n- Added progress indicator showing repos being fetched (e.g., [1/44] Fetching nanoGPT...)\n- Simplified auth error messages (now shows 'authentication failed' instead of stack traces)\n- Shows summary at end: '43 repos synced, 1 skipped'\n- Parallel batches of 8 repos for controlled concurrency"}
